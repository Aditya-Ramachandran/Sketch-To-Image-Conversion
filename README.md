# Sketch To Color Image Conversion 

## Objective 

The objective of this model is to generate the coloured version of sketch images. This is achieved through Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), a deep learning model. Many problems in image processing involve translating an input image into a corresponding output image. Our task is to generate a compatible colored image from a given black-and-white sketch with the help ofÂ deep learning models.
